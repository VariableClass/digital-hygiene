## De-Google your life

[<p align=center><img src="../../res/antitrust.jpg" height="400" /></p>](#de-google-your-life)

Whilst this section references Google, the following really applies to any non-privacy-friendly services you may use, Big Tech or otherwise. If you use an iPhone, your photos are most likely tied up in Apple's iCloud. Google Maps has become the defacto standard for navigation. Simply browsing the web lets Google build up a worringly accurate profile about you. We don't even need to start on why Facebook is an absolute dumpster fire...

Below you will find some open source & privacy-friendly alternatives to some of the most commonly utilised services in our everyday.

### TOTP

> eg. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator

At a minimum, reduce the number of providers that you have entrusted with your data down to one or two.

Try to switch to a provider that supports end-to-end encryption(E2EE), such as [Proton Drive](https://proton.me/drive) or make use of something like [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) to encrypt your files before entrusting them to Google or Microsoft.

## Separating work & home

[<img style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" src="../../res/work-life.png" height="150" />](#separating-work--home)

As part of importing your passwords, you may have found that several work accounts have made their way into your password manager. In an ideal world, your job provides you with a password manager, but even if not, it can be a good idea to separate out logins/information associated with work to a completely separate password manager account.

If you can't get work to pay for this, then [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) has a more than adequate free tier. You can use your work e-mail address to sign up here and it is yet another way to minimise your attack surface. It can also help to keep work and home life separate, since you could, for example, only log in to your work password manager on work devices.
